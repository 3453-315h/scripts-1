This repository is a collection of nmap scripts that are useful for penetration
testing engagements. Some scripts are use to automate large tasks while others 
are used to parse nmap output.

Some of the scripts may require that specific ruby gems are installed for proper
functionality.

If you have any questions please contact us.
